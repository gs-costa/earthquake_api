## Performance Recommendations

1. **Date Range Guidelines**: Recommend date ranges of 1-7 days for optimal performance and reduced API response times
2. **Magnitude Filtering**: Use magnitude filters to reduce result sets and improve query performance
3. **API Monitoring**: Monitor USGS API status and implement fallback strategies for service reliability
4. **Caching Strategy**: Consider implementing caching for frequently requested data to reduce external API calls
5. **Pagination**: Implement client-side pagination for large result sets to improve user experience

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Authentication**: Implement stronger authentication with rotational access tokens for different users and comprehensive user usage tracking
- **Caching Layer**: Add a caching layer using NoSQL database (e.g., Redis) for improved performance and reduced database load
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Create asynchronous tasks to update the database for large date ranges. Divide date ranges into chunks and process ETL operations independently using tools like Celery for better scalability
